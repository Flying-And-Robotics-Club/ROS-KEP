>First, navigate to the source space directory of the catkin workspace you've created.

``` bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```

> Now, use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new package called pkg_ros_basics which depends on std_msgs, roscpp, and rospy:

``` bash
catkin_create_pkg pkg_ros_basics std_msgs rospy roscpp
```

>This will create a beginner_tutorials folder which contains a package.xml and a CMakeLists.txt, which have been partially filled out with the information you gave catkin_create_pkg.  catkin_create_pkg requires that you give it a package_name and optionally a list of dependencies on which that package depends:

``` bash
catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]
```
>  Now, you need to build the packages in the catkin workspace:

``` bash
 cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build
```

> Inside the package, there are src folder, package.xml, CMakeLists.txt, and the include folders.
* CMakeLists.txt: This file has all the commands to build the ROS source code inside the package and create the executable. For more information about CMakeLists visit here.
* package.xml: This is an XML file. It mainly contains the package dependencies, information, and so forth.
* src: The source code of ROS packages are kept in this folder.
